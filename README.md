This is a website about me with my achievements/projects ect.

I was planning to make this website look simple, clean and presentable.
Thus, being able to easily find the points people want to find about me.

For the features, I have pictures that makes the website look less empty
I have my bio which talks about me , what I like and am good at.
I also have my achievements that I got in the past and explained what it is.
For the projects section, I showed pictures of past projects I have done with links connected to the picture.
Finally, I added a Contact Me section. When the submit button is pressed, it tells them that it has been submitted.
However, there are some problems I had with trying to make the website look nice in the mobile view. 
I'm not satisfied with how it looks sometimes but i couldn't find a fix for it.
